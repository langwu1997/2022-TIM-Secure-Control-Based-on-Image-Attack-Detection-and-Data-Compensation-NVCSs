# Co-Design Secure Control Based on Image Attack Detection and Data Compensation for Networked Visual Control Systems

# Introduction
We have investigated a novel co-design secure control method based on image attack detection and data compensation for networked visual control systems. Here, we release the code of our paper for the new scheme used in the networked inverted pendulum visual servo systems (NIPVSSs).

# Demo and data
The demo is divided into 2 folders in document (2022-TIM-Image-Attack-Detection-and-Data-Compensation) using the MATLAB. Run the .m file in the every folders. The requried data is included in the every folders too.

# Ethical proof
All experimental procedures were approved by the Shanghai Key Laboratory of Power Station Automation Technology, School of Mechatronical Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China.
